Project: RAMBLING ALONG

Problem Domain: Our app aims to give users a fun and collaborative means to pass their time, seek entertainment, or use as a fun tool to engage in a social settings.

## CONFLICT PLAN
We will try to avoid having members from inadequately contributing to the project by cultivating an open dialogue and assigning work corporately.
We will resolve any conflicts that arise by opening up discussions and also assess if there is actually a conflict as opposed to there having been a misunderstanding.
We will escalate the conflict if any attempts are unsuccessful and when an individual is not receptive to team suggestions or concerns. At this point, we will approach a TA or instructor to participate in mediating a resolution.
## COMMUNICATION PLAN
Our team has agreed that we will limit working on the project to school hours. If anyone opts to work outside class hours, it must be approved and agreed on in advance. If anyone opts for this, they will work on their branch and merge only after the team reviews the work the following morning. Outside of class hours, we will communicate via Slack. 
We will ensure everyone's voices are heard. After any proposals or questions are posed, we will open up the floor for   discussions. 
We want to create a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up by being constructive in our communication and giving each other our full attention whenever a team member would like to discuss an issue.
